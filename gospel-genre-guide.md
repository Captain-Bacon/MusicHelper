# Gospel Genre Guide

## Overview

Gospel is built on rich harmonic movement and emotional expression. Extended chords (9ths, 11ths, 13ths) are the default—not fancy additions. The sound comes from chromatic voice leading, cluster voicings, and the constant push-pull of tension and release. Where blues stays on the I7 chord, Gospel keeps moving.

## Chord Progressions

### 1. I → bIII → IV → iv

**Chromatic walkdown**

- **Formula:** `I → bIII → IV → iv`
- **Example:** C → Eb → F → Fm
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate
- **Character:** Soulful, churchy
- **Voicing:** Triads

**Notes:** Chromatic walkdown (in bass: C→B→Bb→A if using inversions). The bIII is borrowed from parallel minor, iv is a minor plagal. Creates a deeply emotional, gospel sound. Found in "Oh Happy Day" and countless gospel standards. Voice the bIII carefully to avoid clashes with melody.

---

### 2. IV → iv → I

**The Amen Cadence**

- **Formula:** `IV → iv → I`
- **Example:** F → Fm → C
- **Difficulty:** Beginner
- **Character:** Tender, "Amen"
- **Voicing:** Triads

**Notes:** The plagal cadence with minor iv twist. Known as the "Amen cadence" because it's used to harmonize "A-men" at the end of hymns. The chromaticism (A→Ab) creates a bittersweet resolution. More gentle than V→I. Perfect for endings or quiet moments. Add 7ths for more soul.

---

### 3. I → iii7 → vi7 → ii7 → V7 → I

**Gospel turnaround**

- **Formula:** `I → iii7 → vi7 → ii7 → V7 → I`
- **Example:** C → Em7 → Am7 → Dm7 → G7 → C
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate
- **Character:** Uplifting, classic
- **Voicing:** 7th chords

**Notes:** Gospel turnaround using diatonic 7th chords descending in thirds. The iii7→vi7 movement is particularly sweet. Found in traditional and contemporary gospel. Try adding passing chords between each (like III7 between iii7 and vi7) for a more sophisticated sound. Works great at slow tempos with sustained chords.

---

### 4. I with chromatic bass descent

**Chromatic bass line turnaround**

- **Formula:** `I with chromatic bass descent`
- **Example:** C → C/B → C/Bb → C/A
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate
- **Character:** Smooth, soulful, chromatic
- **Voicing:** Slash chords with chromatic bass

**Notes:** Chromatic bass line turnaround under sustained tonic harmony. The C major triad stays constant in upper voices while bass descends chromatically (C-B-Bb-A). Creates smooth motion leading into a resolution or different chord. The I/Bb (C/Bb) is a chromatic passing sonority - not diatonic but sounds right in gospel context. The I/A often resolves to IV (F) or vi (Am). Found in traditional Black gospel, especially piano-driven arrangements. Keys/organ: left hand walks the bass chromatically, right hand sustains the triad. This teaches gospel chromaticism - the chromatic bass line is a signature sound, creating smooth voice leading and soulful movement.

---

### 5. IMaj7 → bIIIMaj7 → IVMaj7 → IVm7

**Modern parallel major 7ths**

- **Formula:** `IMaj7 → bIIIMaj7 → IVMaj7 → IVm7`
- **Example:** CMaj7 → EbMaj7 → FMaj7 → Fm7
- **Difficulty:** Advanced
- **Character:** Modern, sliding, emotional
- **Voicing:** Maj7 chords

**Notes:** Parallel major 7th chords with chromatic movement. The bIII (Eb) is borrowed from parallel minor but voiced as Maj7, creating lush chromaticism. The final IVm7 adds the minor plagal twist. This is modern gospel harmony - sophisticated voicings, chromatic movement, emotional weight. Found in contemporary gospel choir arrangements and Kirk Franklin productions. The parallel Maj7 voicings (same shape, different roots) slide chromatically. Keys/piano: voice these as close position Maj7s in right hand for maximum shimmer. The chromaticism (E natural to Eb, A to Ab) creates the emotional pull. This bridges traditional gospel chromaticism with contemporary R&B voicings.

---

### 6. I → V/vi → vi → V/ii → ii → V7 → I

**Secondary dominants chain**

- **Formula:** `I → V/vi → vi → V/ii → ii → V7 → I`
- **Example:** C → E7 → Am → A7 → Dm → G7 → C
- **Difficulty:** Advanced
- **Character:** Sophisticated, churchy, harmonic
- **Voicing:** Triads with secondary dominants

**Notes:** Traditional gospel with secondary dominants for harmonic richness. Each diatonic chord (vi, ii) is preceded by its own dominant (V/vi = E7, V/ii = A7). This creates a chain of temporary tonicizations - each chord feels like a mini-key center. The chromatic notes (G#, C#) in the dominants add tension and color. Found in Golden Age gospel (Thomas Dorsey, Mahalia Jackson era). Organ/piano: the secondary dominants should be emphatic - let that G# in E7 ring out before resolving to Am. This teaches functional gospel harmony at its most sophisticated - every chord approached with intention, maximum harmonic movement.

---

### 7. I → vi → IVMaj7 → I/V → V7sus4 → V7

**Contemporary building progression**

- **Formula:** `I → vi → IVMaj7 → I/V → V7sus4 → V7`
- **Example:** C → Am → FMaj7 → C/G → G7sus4 → G7
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate
- **Character:** Contemporary, building, anticipatory
- **Voicing:** Mixed voicings

**Notes:** Contemporary gospel progression that builds anticipation through bass movement and suspension. The I-vi provides gentle descent, IVMaj7 adds sophistication, I/V (second inversion) over dominant bass creates tension, V7sus4 suspends that tension, finally V7 releases it. Common in contemporary praise music and modern gospel arrangements. The bass line ascends (C-A-F-G) creating upward momentum. The sus4 is crucial - often held for a full bar or more to create worship moment anticipation. Choir often holds during sus4 before releasing on V7. This is the bridge between traditional Black gospel and contemporary white worship music - harmonically sophisticated, emotionally building, congregation-friendly.

## Theory

### Overview of Gospel Melody

Gospel melody doesn't stay in scales—it moves through CHORD TONES connected by CHROMATIC RUNS. You're not "in G Mixolydian," you're "targeting G7 chord tones and approaching them chromatically with runs and slides."

#### How It Works

Over a Gospel progression (Dm7 → G7 → CMaj7), you target the chord tones of each chord and connect them with chromatic passing tones and runs. The motion IS the Gospel sound.

- **Dm7 Example:** Target D, F, A, C (Dm7 chord tones). Connect them with chromatic motion—E-Eb-D, F-E-F, G-Ab-A.
- **G7 Example:** Target G, B, D, F (G7 chord tones). Use the 3-to-1 slide: B-Bb-A-Ab-G. Or chromatic walkup: F-F#-G.
- **CMaj7 Example:** Target C, E, G, B (CMaj7 chord tones). Land on root with the 3-to-1: E-Eb-D-Db-C. This is THE Gospel ending.

### Three Key Techniques

#### The 3-to-1 Chromatic Slide

**THE signature Gospel lick**

- **Formula:** `3 - b3 - 2 - b2 - 1` (or just `3 - b3 - 2 - 1`)
- **Description:** From scale degree 3, descend chromatically to root.
- **In C:** E - Eb - D - Db - C (or E - Eb - D - C for quicker version)
- **When:** End of phrases, landing on I chord, turnarounds. Gospel pianists do this every 4 bars.
- **Why:** Creates inevitable, smooth resolution. The chromatic descent (half-steps) pulls strongly to the root.
- **Practice:** Learn in all 12 keys. This appears in EVERY Gospel song. Literally every one.

#### Chromatic Walkup to Next Chord

- **Description:** Walk up chromatically to the root (or 5th) of the next chord. Fast 16th notes.
- **Example:** C to G7: play C-C#-D-D#-E-F-F#-G (landing on G7 in next bar)
- **When:** Last beat of the measure, connecting one chord to the next.
- **Why:** Fills space, creates forward momentum, builds energy.
- **Speed:** FAST. Practice slowly, speed up until it sounds like a blur. Gospel runs are quick.
- **Practice:** Pick two chords. Find chromatic path between their roots. Walk it in 16th notes until automatic.

#### Half-Step Approaches to Chord Tones

- **Description:** Don't land directly on chord tones—approach from half-step above or below.
- **Example:** Landing on C (root of CMaj7): approach from B (below) or Db (above). Creates smooth, inevitable resolution.
- **Over G7:** Approach B (3rd) from Bb. Approach F (7th) from E or Gb. These are guide tones—most important to target.
- **Why:** Half-step motion is STRONG. It creates expectation and smooth voice leading.
- **Practice:** Over any chord, play chord tones approached chromatically. Don't jump—glide into every important note.

### Comparison with Other Genres

**vs Jazz:** Jazz uses chord-scale theory (stay in D Dorian over Dm7, switch to G Mixolydian over G7). Gospel uses chord-tone targeting + chromatic motion. More freedom, more runs, more "churchy" energy.

**vs Blues:** Blues uses one scale over the whole progression (minor pentatonic/blues scale). Gospel changes focus with each chord, following the harmony closely with chromatic connection.

**vs Neo-Soul:** Neo-Soul uses chromatic approaches for smoothness and laid-back feel (one half-step, then resolve). Gospel uses chromatic RUNS for energy and excitement (8-note chromatic walkup at full speed).

**Key Insight:** Gospel melody is FUNCTIONAL, not scalar. You're creating voice-leading between chords, not playing scales. The 3-to-1 slide, chromatic walkups, and approach tones are your tools. Scales are just reference—the motion is what matters.

---

### Typical Keys

Gospel is keyboard-driven and modulation-heavy. Keys are chosen for emotional impact and ease of modulating up (half-step or whole-step key changes).

**Common Keys:** C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, Ab (modulation-friendly, organ-friendly)

**Why:** Gospel songs often modulate UP for energy—C to Db (half-step) or C to D (whole-step). Starting in C, Db, or D sets up multiple modulations. Black-key clusters (Db, Eb, Ab) sound "expensive" on piano. Organ players favor these keys for rich harmonics.

**Avoid:** Keys far from C (F#, B) unless modulating TO them

**Why Avoid:** Gospel pianists learn in C first, build outward. F# and B are endpoints of modulations (you arrive there after multiple key changes), not starting points. Also, congregational singing favors mid-range keys (C-F).

---

### Reference Scales (Context, Not Rules)

These scales show the HARMONIC CONTEXT for Gospel—which notes fit the underlying chords. But don't think "I'm playing in this scale now." Gospel is CHROMATIC—you use all 12 notes as passing tones, runs, and connectors. The scales just show the framework.

#### Gospel Scale

- **Formula:** `1 - 2 - b3 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - b7`
- **Description:** Major scale + blues notes (b3 and b7). Contains both major and minor colors—the Gospel duality.
- **Example:** In C: C - D - Eb - E - F - G - A - Bb
- **Usage:** This shows available melodic colors. The b3→3 movement (Eb to E) is quintessentially Gospel—that "sweet and sour" sound.
- **Context:** You see this scale and think: "I can slide from Eb to E for Gospel flavor." Not "I must stay within these 8 notes."
- **Chromatic:** But remember: Gospel uses ALL 12 notes. This scale is a reference, not a boundary.

#### Mixolydian Mode

- **Formula:** `1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - b7`
- **Description:** Major with b7. Shows available notes when sitting on dominant 7th chords.
- **Example:** In G: G - A - B - C - D - E - F
- **Usage:** When Gospel vamps on a V7 chord (G7) for multiple bars, these notes fit the harmony.
- **Context:** Useful when you're sustaining one dominant chord. But between chords? Chromatic runs.
- **Extensions:** G7 chord = G-B-D-F. Mixolydian adds 9th (A), 13th (E) as safe extensions. But b9 (Ab) is also Gospel—not in Mixolydian but used constantly.

**Caveat:** Gospel is CHROMATIC VOICE-LEADING music. You're not "in a scale"—you're moving between chord tones using chromatic glue. If you try to "stay in Gospel scale" or "stay in Mixolydian," you'll miss the chromatic runs that define the sound. Use the scales as reference for harmonic context, but think "chord tones + chromatic motion" when you play.

---

### Color Tones

Gospel uses chromatic tones for color and voice leading—they're passing tones and tension notes, not defining characteristics like Blues.

- **b3 (flat third):** Quick slide from b3 to 3 in runs. Creates the "churchy" sound. More passing tone than destination. The Eb→E slide in C is iconic Gospel.

- **b7 (flat seventh):** The sound of dominant 7th chords (every V7). Gospel sits on this tension longer than Blues, building anticipation before resolving.

- **b9 (flat ninth):** The "illegal" note. Play b9 over dominant chords for maximum tension. Kirk Franklin uses this CONSTANTLY. Sounds "wrong" but resolves beautifully. On G7, play Ab (b9) in cluster with B (3rd)—extreme dissonance, perfect resolution to C.

**Chromatic Context:** These are not "scale degrees"—they're CHROMATIC TENSIONS. You use them for color, then resolve. Gospel doesn't avoid "wrong" notes—it leans into dissonance and resolves it with voice leading.

---

### Gospel vs Blues: Harmony in Motion

**Explanation:** Blues stays on one chord (I7) for 4 bars. Gospel moves CONSTANTLY—ii7 → V7 → I in 2 bars, often with chromatic passing chords in between.

**Example:** In C: Dm7 (ii) → G7 (V) → CMaj7 (I) is the foundation. But Gospel adds: Dm7 → Db7 → CMaj7 (chromatic approach). Or: Dm7 → G7 → CMaj7 → Am7 → D7 → GMaj7 (immediate re-pivot to new key).

**Why:** Gospel inherited Blues' emotional core but added Jazz's harmonic sophistication. More chords = more opportunities for tension and release = more emotional peaks.

**Melodic Implication:** Because chords change every 1-2 bars, Gospel melody must TRACK the harmony. You can't play one scale over everything—you must follow the chord progression with chord-tone targeting and chromatic connection.

---

### Chord Construction

Gospel chords are built from major and minor scales, but extended chords (9ths, 11ths, 13ths) are DEFAULT. If you play triads in Gospel, it sounds empty.

#### Triads

- **Explanation:** Basic building block: 1-3-5. Gospel RARELY plays bare triads—they sound too simple.
- **Formula:** `1 - 3 - 5`
- **Example:** C major triad = C-E-G (but you'll almost never play this in Gospel without extensions)

#### Seventh Chords

The 7th is ALWAYS there. Major 7th (I, IV) vs Dominant 7th (V, secondary dominants) vs Minor 7th (ii, iii, vi).

**Major 7th:**

- **Formula:** `1 - 3 - 5 - 7`
- **Example:** CMaj7 = C-E-G-B. Stable, resolved sound. Use on I and IV chords.
- **Sound:** Complete, peaceful. This is "home" in Gospel.

**Dominant 7th:**

- **Formula:** `1 - 3 - 5 - b7`
- **Example:** G7 = G-B-D-F. Tense, wants to resolve. Use on V chord and secondary dominants.
- **Sound:** Unresolved yearning. Sits on this tension, then releases to Major7th.
- **Tritone:** The 3rd and b7 form a tritone (B and F in G7). Gospel exploits this—holds it, decorates it with b9 and 13th, then resolves.

**Minor 7th:**

- **Formula:** `1 - b3 - 5 - b7`
- **Example:** Dm7 = D-F-A-C. Mellow, sets up the V7. Use on ii, iii, vi chords.
- **Sound:** Transitional, moving toward resolution.

#### Extensions

**What They Are:** Gospel REQUIRES extensions. They're not decorative—they ARE the Gospel sound. 9ths, 11ths, 13ths are standard, not advanced.

**Naming:** 9th = 2nd octave up, 11th = 4th octave up, 13th = 6th octave up. But in Gospel, you play them in close position (clustered), not literally an octave higher.

**Common Extensions:**

- **9th:** On everything. Dm9 instead of Dm7. G9 instead of G7. CMaj9 instead of CMaj7. Adds shimmer and fullness.

- **b9:** The SECRET. On dominant chords only (V7). G7b9 has Ab over G7. Sounds dissonant alone but resolves perfectly. Kirk Franklin, Tye Tribbett, Israel Houghton—they all use this.

- **11th:** Adds dreamy, suspended quality. Often played as sus4 (4th, not 11th name) on minor chords. Dm11 = D-F-A-C-G. Huge, open sound.

- **13th:** The jazzy sound. Dominant chords with 13th (G13 = G-B-D-F-E) sound sophisticated. If you add b9 AND 13th (G7b9b13), maximum tension—resolves like magic.

**In Practice:** Stack these in CLOSE POSITION. Left hand: root + 7th (shell). Right hand: 3rd + extensions clustered together. The cluster (2nds, tight voicing) creates the Gospel tension.

---

### The Cluster Voicing Secret

**Why Gospel Sounds "Expensive"**

**Concept:** Play notes close together (2nds, not 3rds) in the right hand. This creates dissonance that defines modern Gospel sound.

**Why:** Spreading notes out in 3rds sounds "pretty." Clustering them in 2nds sounds TENSE. Gospel thrives on tension → release.

**Example:** CMaj9: Left hand = C + B (root and 7th). Right hand = D-E-G (9th, 3rd, 5th) clustered tight. That D-E (9th to 3rd) is a 2nd—it creates the shimmer.

**Kirk Franklin:** Stacks 9ths, 11ths, 13ths in the right hand, all within an octave. Not "C major with extensions"—more like "C with a cluster of sound."

**Practice:** Take any Major7 chord. Left hand: root + 7th. Right hand: play 9th, 3rd, 5th as close together as comfortable. Feel the tension. Now resolve to the I chord—that's Gospel.

---

## Piano Voicings

### Shell Voicing

**Concept:** Left hand plays only essential notes (root + 7th). This is the foundation.

**Left Hand:** Root + 7th. For Major7: root + major 7th (C + B for CMaj7). For Dominant7: root + b7 (G + F for G7). For Minor7: root + b7 (D + C for Dm7).

**Why:** Leaves room for the right hand to add extensions without mud. The left hand is the anchor; right hand is the color.

### Right Hand Clusters

**Concept:** Right hand plays 3rd + extensions in CLOSE POSITION (within an octave, often within a 6th).

**CMaj9 Example:** CMaj9: LH = C + B (shell). RH = D-E-G (9th, 3rd, 5th clustered). Or E-G-D (3rd, 5th, 9th). Arrange for smoothest voice leading.

**G7b9 Example:** G7b9: LH = G + F (shell). RH = Ab-B-D (b9, 3rd, 5th clustered). That Ab-B is a minor 3rd—very tight, very tense. Resolves to CMaj9 beautifully.

**Voice Leading:** Move the right hand cluster with MINIMAL motion between chords. If CMaj9 (E-G-D) goes to Dm9 (F-A-E), each note moves by step. Smooth voice leading is the Gospel secret.

### Left-Right-Right Pattern

**Concept:** The Gospel comp pattern: Left (bass note) → Right → Right (bounce the right hand cluster twice).

**Feel:** Left-RIGHT-right, Left-RIGHT-right. The left hand is on the beat, right hand is on the "and" and the next "and." Creates bounce and syncopation.

**Example:** Count: 1 (left) & (right) 2 (right) & (left) 3 (right) & (right) 4 (right). OR: 1 (left) & (right) 2 & (left) 3 (right) & 4 (right). Vary the pattern—it's a feel, not a rule.

**Practice:** Start slow. Left hand on beats 1 and 3, right hand bounces on "and" of 1, beat 2, "and" of 3, beat 4. This is the heartbeat of Gospel piano.

**Kirk Franklin:** Piano parts use this constantly. The right hand "chatter" over a solid left hand bass line.

### Choke Technique

**Description:** Play the chord, immediately release (staccato). Creates percussive, rhythmic punctuation.

**When:** On backbeat (beats 2 and 4) for emphasis. Or at the end of a phrase to "choke" the sound and create space.

**Sound:** Like a snare hit but harmonic. Adds attack and clarity in dense mixes.

**Practice:** Play CMaj9, release immediately. Feel the "choke." Now do it on beat 2 of a Gospel progression—instant Gospel rhythm.

### Runs

**Description:** Quick scalar passages connecting chords. Gospel runs are FAST and CHROMATIC.

**Ascending:** Chromatic walkup to the next chord. In C going to G7: play C-C#-D-D#-E-F-F#-G, landing on G7. Use chromatic notes as glue.

**Descending:** Gospel "fall" or "cascading run." Start high (9th or 13th of the chord), cascade down the scale to root. Use major scale + chromatic passing tones.

**3-to-1:** The signature Gospel run: start on 3rd of the scale, slide chromatically down to root. In C: E-Eb-D-Db-C (or just E-Eb-D-C). Play this FAST. Instant Kirk Franklin.

**Practice:** Learn the 3-to-1 run in all 12 keys. It appears EVERYWHERE in Gospel—ends of phrases, turnarounds, between chords.

### Tremolo and Repeating Notes

**Description:** Rapid repetition of notes or chords for energy and intensity.

**Tremolo:** Rapidly alternate between two notes (usually root and 5th, or root and octave) in the left hand. Builds tension.

**Right Hand Repeat:** Repeat the right hand cluster rapidly (16th notes) while left hand holds the bass. Creates urgency and drive.

**When:** During builds, before key changes, in the "shout" section. Maximum energy.

---

## Guitar Voicings

**Basic:** Use Major7, Dominant7, and Minor7 chord shapes. Add 9ths and sus4 chords for Gospel flavor.

**Extensions:** Add the 9th to any chord. Dm9, G9, CMaj9. Learn the "jazz shapes" with added 9ths—they're Gospel staples.

**Sus:** Sus2 and sus4 chords (replace 3rd with 2nd or 4th) create open, ambiguous sound. Asus2, Dsus4. Resolving sus → major is classic Gospel move.

**Open Voicings:** Spread the chord across all 6 strings for huge, ringing sound. Use open strings where possible. Very common in contemporary worship (Hillsong, Elevation).

**Rhythm Technique:** Muted strumming with quick accents. Palm mute the verses, open up for chorus. Syncopated strumming (hitting on the "and" not the beat) is key.

**Mixing:** Gospel guitar is often rhythmic, not solo-focused. Comp with the keys, add fills between vocal phrases, play chord stabs on 2 and 4.

---

## Gospel Harmonic Movement

Gospel uses VAMPS—short 2-4 bar sections that repeat. The progression moves constantly, not sitting on one chord for bars.

### ii7 → V7 → I (The Foundation)

- **Formula:** `ii7 → V7 → IMaj7`
- **In C:** Dm7 → G7 → CMaj7
- **Why:** The fundamental Gospel progression. Creates strong sense of resolution. Happens constantly—end of every phrase, every turnaround.
- **Extensions:** Make it Dm9 → G7b9 → CMaj9. Now it sounds expensive.

### The Amen Cadence (IV → I)

- **Formula:** `IVMaj7 → IMaj7`
- **In C:** FMaj7 → CMaj7
- **Why:** The sound of "A-men" at the end of hymns. Gentle, resolved. Very common in traditional Gospel.
- **Variation:** IV → iv → I (FMaj7 → Fm7 → CMaj7). The iv (minor four) adds melancholy before resolving. Stolen from Blues, used constantly in Gospel.

### Chromatic Approach Chord

**Concept:** Play a chord a half-step above or below your target, then resolve.

**Example:** Going to CMaj7? Play Db7 (half-step above), then CMaj7. The Db7 is a "chromatic approach" or "tritone sub."

**Sound:** Creates surprise and sophistication. The Db7 "shouldn't" go to C, but it does—smooth voice leading makes it work.

**Common:** Dm7 → Db7 → CMaj7 (approach the I from above). Or: Dm7 → G7 → Gb7 → FMaj7 (approach the IV from above).

### The Gospel Vamp

**Description:** A 2-4 bar section that repeats indefinitely. The band locks into the vamp while the lead improvises.

**Common:** IMaj7 → VIMaj7 → IIMaj7 → V7 (in C: CMaj7 → AMaj7 → DMaj7 → G7). Repeat forever. Or: I → IV → V → IV (repeat).

**When:** End of songs, "shout" sections, builds. The vamp creates hypnotic, trance-like groove. Energy keeps building with each repeat.

**Technique:** Add fills, runs, and rhythmic variations each time through. Never play it exactly the same twice.

### Secondary Dominants

**Concept:** Treat any chord as if it's the I, and play its V7. Creates temporary key changes.

**Example:** In C, going to Dm7 (the ii)? Play A7 (the V of Dm) first. So: A7 → Dm7. You've temporarily treated Dm as the I.

**Sound:** Adds harmonic richness. Creates more tension points. Gospel uses these CONSTANTLY.

**Notation:** Written as V7/ii (five of two), V7/vi (five of six), etc. In C: A7 is V7/ii, E7 is V7/vi.

### Modulation / Key Change

**Description:** Change the key of the song, usually up a half-step or whole-step. Creates energy and excitement.

**When:** Final chorus, "shout" section, to build intensity.

**Technique:** Common move: ii7 → V7 of NEW key → I of new key. In C going to Db: Ebm7 → Ab7 → DbMaj7. Instant lift.

**Half-Step:** C to Db (half-step up). Smooth, sophisticated.

**Whole-Step:** C to D (whole-step up). Bigger lift, more dramatic.

---

## Turnarounds

**Description:** Gospel turnarounds are called "Gospel turns"—quick ii-V-I moves or chromatic runs that reset back to the I chord.

**Common:** ii7 → V7 → I with chromatic walkup in the last beat. In C: Dm7 (2 beats) → G7 (2 beats) → chromatic run (C-C#-D-D#-E-F-F#-G) → CMaj7.

**3-to-1 Run:** End any phrase with the 3-to-1 chromatic slide: E-Eb-D-Db-C (landing on C chord). This IS Gospel.

**Descending Bass:** Walk the bass down chromatically from I to V: C → B → Bb → A → Ab → G (landing on G7 as the V). Classic Gospel turnaround.

---

## Rhythm & Feel

### Gospel Feel

**Description:** Gospel lives on the BACKBEAT (beats 2 and 4). Heavily syncopated—anticipations, offbeat accents. "Shout feel" sections use dotted rhythms and driving 16th notes.

**Time Signature:** 4/4, but FELT as syncopated and anticipatory.

**Backbeat:** Beats 2 and 4 are everything. Snare hits, hand claps, chord chokes—all on 2 and 4.

**Syncopation:** Play notes BEFORE the beat (anticipate) or on the "and" (offbeat). This creates the bounce and forward momentum.

**Shout Feel:** In uptempo Gospel (the "shout" section), use dotted rhythms: LONG-short-LONG-short. Sounds like: BOM-ba-BOM-ba. Creates driving, ecstatic energy.

### Call and Response

**Description:** Inherited from Blues. Choir sings a line, congregation responds. Piano plays a phrase, choir answers. Creates dialogue and participation.

**Why:** Gospel is communal, not solo performance. Call-and-response invites participation—it's conversation, not lecture.

**Practice:** Play a 2-bar chord progression, leave 2 bars of space. Listen to how the silence creates expectation. Now fill the space with a run or respond with vocals.

### Keys/Piano Rhythm

**Comp Pattern:** Left-RIGHT-right, Left-RIGHT-right (left hand on beat, right hand bounces on offbeats). This is the Gospel piano heartbeat.

**Choke:** Choke chords (staccato hits) on beats 2 and 4 for percussive punctuation. Instant Gospel feel.

**Runs:** Fill the space between vocal phrases with chromatic runs (3-to-1, ascending walkups). Never leave dead space—Gospel piano is BUSY.

**Tremolo:** Rapid repetition of bass notes or right hand chords during builds. Creates urgency and intensity.

**Shout:** In shout sections, pound 16th notes in the right hand (cluster chords repeated rapidly) while left hand drives the bass. Maximum energy.

### Guitar Rhythm

**Strumming:** Muted, syncopated strumming. Hit on the "and" of beats, not the beats themselves. Creates bounce.

**Accents:** Accent beats 2 and 4 (open up the mute, strum louder). Matches the backbeat.

**Chord Stabs:** Quick, staccato chord hits on 2 and 4. Let the chord ring just briefly, then mute. Percussive and tight.

**Fills:** Add single-note fills or small runs between vocal phrases. Don't overplay—leave space for vocals and keys.

**Open Strings:** Use open strings for big, ringing chords. Very common in contemporary worship. Capo to change key while keeping open string voicings.

### Hand Claps

**Description:** Congregation hand claps on beats 2 and 4. This IS Gospel—if there are no claps, it doesn't feel like church.

**Why:** Participation, energy, communal worship. The claps drive the rhythm and unite the congregation.

---

## Licks

### 1. The Chromatic Walkup

**THE Gospel Move**

**Description:** Walk up chromatically to the target note (usually 5th or root of next chord). This is the sound everyone recognizes as Gospel.

**Keys:** In C: going to G7, play C-C#-D-D#-E-F-F#-G on beat 4 (16th notes), landing on G7 in next bar. FAST. Practice slowly, speed up until it's a blur.

**Guitar:** Walk up on bass strings (low E or A string) chromatically to the root of next chord. Or use chromatic passing tones on inner strings between chord tones.

---

### 2. The 3-to-1 Slide

**Kirk Franklin's Signature**

**Description:** Start on scale degree 3, slide chromatically down to 1. THE Gospel piano ending lick.

**Keys:** In C: E-Eb-D-Db-C (fast). Or just E-Eb-D-C (4 notes). Play this at the end of EVERY phrase. Literally every Gospel pianist uses this. It's the law.

**Guitar:** Slide on the B or high E string from 3rd to root. In C: slide from G (3rd) down to E (root on high E string). Quick, subtle.

---

### 3. The Cluster Voicing Choke

**Description:** Play a cluster chord (9th, 3rd, 5th tight in right hand), then immediately release (choke). Creates percussive, tense hit.

**Keys:** CMaj9: LH = C+B, RH = D-E-G (tight cluster). Hit it, choke it (release immediately). Do this on beat 2 or 4 for instant Gospel rhythm.

**Guitar:** Not applicable—use chord stabs (quick muted strums) instead.

---

### 4. The Tritone Substitution

**Description:** Replace V7 with bII7 (the chord a tritone away). Sounds "wrong" but resolves perfectly due to shared tritone.

**Keys:** In C: instead of G7 → CMaj7, play Db7 → CMaj7. The Db7 is the tritone sub. Shared tritone (F and B) creates smooth voice leading.

**Guitar:** Rare on guitar (harder to voice), but try it: instead of G7, play Db7 (barre chord). Land on CMaj7. Sounds jazzy and sophisticated.

---

### 5. The Amen Ending (IV → I)

**Description:** The classic Gospel ending. Play IV → I (or IV → iv → I for extra emotion).

**Keys:** In C: FMaj7 → CMaj7. Or FMaj7 → Fm7 → CMaj7 (the minor four adds melancholy). Add a 3-to-1 run on the CMaj7 for proper ending.

**Guitar:** Strum IV chord (F), let it ring, then resolve to I (C). Add sus4 (Csus4 → C) on the I for extra resolution.

---

### 6. The Gospel Turnaround (ii → V → I with chromatic bass)

**Description:** Play ii7 → V7 → I while the bass walks down chromatically.

**Keys:** In C: Dm7 → G7 → CMaj7, but bass line walks C → B → Bb → A → Ab → G → (land on C). Creates smooth, inevitable pull back to I.

**Guitar:** Walk bass notes on low E or A string while strumming ii-V-I chords above. Chromatic bass line is the secret.

---

### 7. Secondary Dominant Lick (V7/vi)

**Description:** Play the dominant of the vi chord (E7 in C) to create temporary tension, then resolve to vi (Am).

**Keys:** In C: play E7 → Am7 → Dm7 → G7 → CMaj7. The E7 (V of Am) is the secondary dominant. It "shouldn't" be in C major, but it works—adds color.

**Guitar:** Same progression. E7 barre chord to Am7. Sounds sophisticated and jazzy.

---

### 8. The Ascending Run (Chromatic Scale Fragment)

**Description:** Quick ascending chromatic run to next chord. Fills space, builds energy.

**Keys:** Play chromatic scale fragment (5-8 notes) ascending to the root of next chord. Fast 16th notes. In C going to F: play C-D-Eb-E-F (landing on F chord).

**Guitar:** Chromatic run on one string (usually G or B string) between chords. Quick, understated.

---

### 9. The Descending "Fall" (Cascading Run)

**Description:** Start high (9th or 13th), cascade down to root. Gospel pianists do this at phrase endings.

**Keys:** In CMaj9: start on D (9th), cascade down C major scale to C root. Add chromatic passing tones (C-B-Bb-A-Ab-G-F#-F-E-Eb-D-Db-C). Fast and flashy.

**Guitar:** Descending scale run on high strings. Start on 12th fret, walk down to open position. Let it ring.

---

### 10. The b9 Secret (Flat Nine Over Dominant)

**Description:** Add b9 to any dominant 7th chord. Sounds dissonant alone, but resolves like butter.

**Keys:** G7b9: LH = G+F (shell), RH = Ab-B-D (b9, 3rd, 5th cluster). That Ab is the "illegal" note—it clashes with G, but when it resolves to C (Ab moves down to G), it sounds intentional and beautiful.

**Guitar:** Hard to voice on guitar. Try G7 with added Ab note if you can reach it. More common on keys.

## Practice Resources

### Backing Tracks

**Search:** "Gospel Backing Track" or "Worship Backing Track" + your key. Or: "ii-V-I Gospel progression"

**Listen For:** Strong backbeat on 2 & 4, syncopated piano comping (left-right-right), space for vocal phrases

**Recommended:**

- Medium tempo (80-100 BPM) for learning
- Uptempo (120-140 BPM) for shout feel practice

**Tip:** Search artist-specific: "Kirk Franklin style track", "Tye Tribbett Gospel progression", "Israel Houghton worship track"

---

### Exercises

1. Practice left-right-right comp pattern (left hand on 1 & 3, right hand bounces on offbeats) until it's automatic

2. Learn the 3-to-1 chromatic slide (3-b3-2-b2-1) in all 12 keys. Play it at the end of every phrase.

3. Practice ii7 → V7 → I in all 12 keys with extensions (Dm9 → G7b9 → CMaj9). Focus on smooth voice leading.

4. Chromatic walkup exercise: Play I chord, then chromatically walk up to V chord (8 16th notes). Repeat in all keys.

5. Cluster voicing practice: Build Major9 chords with cluster in right hand (9th, 3rd, 5th tight). Feel the tension.

6. Play a 4-bar vamp (I-vi-ii-V) and repeat 8 times, adding different runs and fills each time. Never play it the same twice.

### Progression Path

**Beginner**

- Goal: Learn ii7-V7-I in 3 keys (C, G, F). Practice left-right-right comp pattern. Play simple Major7 and Dominant7 chords with extensions (add 9ths).

**Intermediate**

- Goal: Add chromatic walkups/walkdowns. Learn cluster voicings (tight 9ths in right hand). Practice 3-to-1 slide in all keys. Play 4-bar vamps and add fills. Learn Amen cadence and secondary dominants.

**Advanced**

- Goal: Master b9 chords over dominants. Smooth voice leading across ii-V-I-vi-ii-V progressions. Improvise runs (chromatic, 3-to-1, cascading falls) in real-time. Play in all 12 keys. Modulate up by half-step or whole-step mid-song.

### Common Mistakes

❌ Playing triads without extensions—sounds empty in Gospel. Always add 9ths.

❌ Playing on the beat instead of syncopating—kills the Gospel feel. Anticipate, play on the "and."

❌ Ignoring the backbeat (2 & 4)—Gospel lives here. Clap, choke, accent beats 2 and 4.

❌ Sparse left hand—Gospel bass line moves constantly. Walk, jump octaves, fill the low end.

❌ Playing the same voicing every time—voice leading is KEY. Move each note minimally between chords.

❌ Skipping the b9 on dominant chords—this is the secret sauce. It sounds "wrong" but it's RIGHT.

❌ No space between phrases—even Gospel, which is busy, needs breath. Call-and-response requires rests.
