                                <p><strong>Uppercase = Major chords:</strong> I, IV, V (in C: C, F, G)</p>
                                <p><strong>Lowercase = Minor chords:</strong> ii, iii, vi (in C: Dm, Em, Am)</p>

                                <h4>Secondary/Applied Chords (V7/x)</h4>
                                <p><strong>V7/IV</strong> = "The dominant 7th <em>of</em> IV" → Build V7 in the key of IV</p>
                                <p><strong>Example in C:</strong> V7/IV = C7 (V7 in key of F)</p>
                                <p><strong>V7/vi</strong> = E7 (V7 of Am), <strong>vii°7/V</strong> = F#dim7 (vii°7 of G)</p>
                                <p><em>Why it works:</em> Creates chromatic notes that pull strongly to target chord</p>

                                <h4>Figured Bass / Inversions</h4>
                                <p><strong>V6/4</strong> = Second inversion V (5th in bass) → G/D in C</p>
                                <p><strong>I6</strong> = First inversion I (3rd in bass) → C/E in C</p>
                                <p><strong>I/III</strong> = Slash chord notation (I with III in bass) → C/E</p>
                                <p><em>Use:</em> Smooth bass movement, classical cadences</p>

                                <p><strong>m7</strong> = minor 7th (Dm7 = D-F-A-C)</p>
                                <p><strong>dim7 or °7</strong> = diminished 7th (Bdim7 = B-D-F-Ab)</p>
                                <p><strong>ø7 or m7b5</strong> = half-diminished 7th (Bm7b5 = B-D-F-A)</p>
                                <p><strong>°</strong> = diminished triad (Bdim = B-D-F)</p>
