# Key Transitions Reference

Smooth ways to transition between keys, organized by starting key.

## From D

| To | Relationship | Transition |
|----|--------------|------------|
| A | D is IV of A | D → E → A (IV-V-I) |
| G | D is V of G | D → G (V-I) |
| C | D is II of C | D → G → C (chain of Vs) |
| Bb | D is III of Bb | D → F → Bb |
| B | D is bIII of B | D → F# → B |
| E | D is bVII of E | D → E (bVII-I) |

## From A

| To | Relationship | Transition |
|----|--------------|------------|
| D | A is V of D | A → D (V-I) |
| G | A is II of G | A → D → G (chain of Vs) |
| C | A is VI of C | A → G → C |
| Bb | A is VII of Bb | A → Bb (semitone up) |
| B | A is bVII of B | A → B (bVII-I) |
| E | A is IV of E | A → B → E (IV-V-I) |

## From G

| To | Relationship | Transition |
|----|--------------|------------|
| D | G is IV of D | G → A → D (IV-V-I) |
| A | G is bVII of A | G → A (bVII-I) |
| C | G is V of C | G → C (V-I) |
| Bb | G is VI of Bb | G → F → Bb |
| B | G is bVI of B | G → F# → B (bVI-V-I) |
| E | G is bIII of E | G → B → E |

## From C

| To | Relationship | Transition |
|----|--------------|------------|
| D | C is bVII of D | C → D (bVII-I) |
| A | C is bIII of A | C → E → A |
| G | C is IV of G | C → D → G (IV-V-I) |
| Bb | C is II of Bb | C → F → Bb |
| B | C is bII of B | C → B (semitone down) |
| E | C is bVI of E | C → B → E (bVI-V-I) |

## From Bb

| To | Relationship | Transition |
|----|--------------|------------|
| D | Bb is bVI of D | Bb → A → D (bVI-V-I) |
| A | Bb is bII of A | Bb → A (semitone down) |
| G | Bb is bIII of G | Bb → D → G |
| C | Bb is bVII of C | Bb → C (bVII-I) |
| B | Bb is bI/VII of B | Bb → B (semitone up) |
| E | Bb is bV of E | Bb → E (tritone sub!) |

## From B

| To | Relationship | Transition |
|----|--------------|------------|
| D | B is VI of D | B → A → D |
| A | B is II of A | B → E → A |
| G | B is III of G | B → D → G |
| C | B is VII of C | B → C (semitone up) |
| Bb | B is bII of Bb | B → Bb (semitone down) |
| E | B is V of E | B → E (V-I) |

## From E

| To | Relationship | Transition |
|----|--------------|------------|
| D | E is II of D | E → A → D |
| A | E is V of A | E → A (V-I) |
| G | E is VI of G | E → D → G |
| C | E is III of C | E → G → C |
| Bb | E is bV of Bb | E → Bb (tritone sub!) |
| B | E is IV of B | E → F# → B (IV-V-I) |

## Notes

- Relationships show functional role of starting key in destination key
- Chain of Vs = descending fifths pattern (very smooth)
- Tritone substitution = dramatic jump (augmented 4th/diminished 5th)
- Semitone moves = direct chromatic shift (bold but effective)
