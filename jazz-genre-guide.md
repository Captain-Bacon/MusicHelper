# Jazz Genre Guide

## Overview

Jazz is built on harmonic sophistication and conversational melody. The ii-V-I progression is the foundation. Extended chords (7ths, 9ths, 11ths, 13ths) are essential. The language is chord-scale relationships—different scales for different chords, not one scale for the whole song.

---

## Chord Progressions

### 1. ii7 → V7 → IMaj7
**The fundamental jazz cadence**

- **Formula:** `ii7 → V7 → IMaj7`
- **Example:** Dm7 → G7 → CMaj7
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate
- **Character:** Warm, resolved
- **Voicing:** 7th chords

**Notes:** The fundamental jazz cadence. The ii-V creates a smooth approach to I through the cycle of fifths. Used as a turnaround, ending, or harmonic rhythm pattern. The tritone in V7 (B-F) resolves outward (C-E in CMaj7). Master this and you can play through 90% of jazz standards.

---

### 2. IMaj7 → vi7 → ii7 → V7
**The jazz circle progression**

- **Formula:** `IMaj7 → vi7 → ii7 → V7`
- **Example:** CMaj7 → Am7 → Dm7 → G7
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate
- **Character:** Smooth, flowing
- **Voicing:** 7th chords

**Notes:** The "jazz circle progression." All roots descend by fifths (or up by fourths). Used in "Autumn Leaves," "Fly Me to the Moon." Creates strong forward motion through the cycle. Practice voice-leading where each 7th resolves down by step to the 3rd of the next chord.

---

### 3. bVII7 → IMaj7
**The backdoor resolution**

- **Formula:** `bVII7 → IMaj7`
- **Example:** Bb7 → CMaj7
- **Difficulty:** Advanced
- **Character:** Hip, unexpected
- **Voicing:** 7th chords

**Notes:** The "backdoor resolution" or "backdoor ii-V." The bVII7 functions as a substitute for ii-V, approaching I from above instead of below. Creates a darker, bluesier sound than a standard resolution. Found in bebop and modal jazz. The bVII is borrowed from C minor (parallel minor).

---

### 4. ii7 → bII7 → IMaj7
**Tritone substitution**

- **Formula:** `ii7 → bII7 → IMaj7`
- **Example:** Dm7 → Db7 → CMaj7
- **Difficulty:** Advanced
- **Character:** Sophisticated, tense
- **Voicing:** 7th chords

**Notes:** Tritone substitution: bII7 (Db7) replaces V7 (G7). They share the same tritone (F-B / B-F) but resolve differently. Creates chromatic bass motion (D→Db→C). Used extensively in bebop and modern jazz. The altered tensions on bII7 (b9, #9, #11) add spice.

---

### 5. IIIMaj7 → VIMaj7 → IIMaj7 → VMaj7
**Coltrane Changes fragment**

- **Formula:** `IIIMaj7 → VIMaj7 → IIMaj7 → VMaj7`
- **Example:** EMaj7 → AMaj7 → DMaj7 → GMaj7
- **Difficulty:** Advanced
- **Character:** Bright, modal
- **Voicing:** Maj7 chords

**Notes:** Coltrane Changes fragment (from "Giant Steps"). All major 7th chords whose roots are major thirds apart. Creates a bright, constantly modulating sound. Extremely challenging to improvise over as the key center shifts every chord. Practice slowly, thinking of each chord as a temporary key.

---

## Theory

### Chord Construction

Jazz uses extended chords as the default—7th chords are basic, 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths are standard color. Triads sound incomplete and un-jazzy. Understanding chord construction is essential because chord-scale theory connects scales to chord types.

#### Triads

**Three-note chords: root, 3rd, 5th**

- **Formula:** `1 - 3 - 5`
- **Example:** C major triad = C - E - G
- **Why:** The 3rd determines major (happy) vs minor (sad). The 5th provides stability. But triads lack sophistication—jazz adds more.
- **Note:** Jazz rarely uses plain triads—they sound bare. But understanding triads is the foundation.

#### Seventh Chords

**Add the 7th scale degree to the triad**

The 7th defines the chord's harmonic function. This is where jazz starts.

- **Formula:** `1 - 3 - 5 - 7`
- **Four main types:**
  - **Maj7** = `1-3-5-7` (stable, resolved, "home")
  - **m7** = `1-b3-5-b7` (transitional, moving)
  - **Dom7** = `1-3-5-b7` (tension, wants to resolve)
  - **m7b5** = `1-b3-b5-b7` (fragile, unstable)

**Example in C:**
- CMaj7 = C-E-G-B
- Dm7 = D-F-A-C
- G7 = G-B-D-F
- Bm7b5 = B-D-F-A

**Why this matters:**
- **Maj7** sounds pretty and complete
- **Dom7** sounds tense and unresolved
- **m7** sounds smooth and jazzy
- **m7b5** sounds dark and searching

#### Extensions

Extensions add notes beyond the octave: 9th (2nd octave higher), 11th (4th octave higher), 13th (6th octave higher). Jazz players use extensions constantly for color and sophistication.

- **Formula:** `1 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 9 - 11 - 13`
- **Example:** Cmaj13 contains: C (root), E (3rd), G (5th), B (7th), D (9th), F (11th), A (13th)—all 7 notes of C major scale stacked in 3rds

**Voicing:** You rarely play all 7 notes. Pick root + 3rd + 7th (defines the chord) + one or two extensions for color. Example: C-E-B-D (CMaj9 voicing).

**Why:** Extensions add harmonic richness without changing the chord's function. CMaj7, CMaj9, CMaj13 all function as "I" chord—extensions just add color.

**Tensions:** Available tensions depend on chord type. Major 7 chords can use 9 and 13 freely, but 11 clashes (half-step above 3rd). Dominant 7 chords can alter tensions (b9, #9, #11, b13) for color.

#### Why This Matters for Chord-Scale Theory

Every scale in jazz is chosen to match a chord TYPE. When you see Dm7, you know: root (D), minor 3rd (F), 5th (A), minor 7th (C). The scale you choose (D Dorian) contains those chord tones PLUS the available extensions (9, 11, 13). That's the connection—scales provide chord tones + color notes.

**Example:** Dm7 uses D Dorian (D-E-F-G-A-B-C). Chord tones: D-F-A-C. Extensions: E (9th), G (11th), B (13th). All safe to use. That's why D Dorian works over Dm7.

---

### Chord-Scale Theory: The Jazz System

Unlike Blues or Rock (where one scale works over the entire progression), Jazz uses DIFFERENT SCALES for DIFFERENT CHORD TYPES. The scale you improvise with must match the chord sounding underneath at that moment.

**Example: ii-V-I in C Major**
- **Chords:** Dm7 → G7 → CMaj7
- **Scales:** D Dorian → G Mixolydian → C Ionian
- **Breakdown:** Three chords, three different scales, three different roots. You switch scales as the chord changes.

**Why:** Each scale contains the chord tones (1-3-5-7) PLUS the available tensions (9, 11, 13) for that specific chord type. This creates melodic color while staying harmonically connected.

**vs Blues/Rock:**
- Blues uses minor pentatonic over everything—one unified sound
- Rock uses pentatonic over power chords—freedom through ambiguity
- Jazz tracks the harmony closely—sophistication through chord-awareness

**Practice Approach:** Don't think "I'm in the key of C." Think "This chord is Dm7, I use D Dorian. Now it's G7, I switch to G Mixolydian." Your melodic choices change with each chord.

---

### Scales By Chord Type

Here are the jazz scales organized by CHORD TYPE. When you see a chord, find its type below, then play the corresponding scale from that chord's ROOT.

#### For Major 7 Chords (Maj7, Maj9, Maj13)

**Chord Types:** IMaj7, IVMaj7
**Character:** Stable, resolved, "home" feeling
**When to Use:** When a Major 7 chord is sounding (CMaj7, FMaj7 in the key of C)

##### Ionian Mode (Major Scale)

- **Formula:** `1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7`
- **Description:** The default choice for Major 7 chords. Natural, consonant major sound.
- **Example:** C Ionian over CMaj7: C - D - E - F - G - A - B
- **Chord Tones:** Root (C), Major 3rd (E), Perfect 5th (G), Major 7th (B)
- **Available Tensions:** 9th (D), 11th (F, use sparingly—can clash with 3rd), 13th (A)
- **Sound:** Bright, consonant, "pretty." The safe choice for Major 7.
- **Usage:** Use on IMaj7 in major keys. Bill Evans, Oscar Peterson use this constantly.

##### Lydian Mode

- **Formula:** `1 - 2 - 3 - #4 - 5 - 6 - 7`
- **Description:** Ionian with raised 4th. Brighter, dreamier than Ionian.
- **Example:** F Lydian over FMaj7: F - G - A - B - C - D - E
- **Chord Tones:** Root (F), Major 3rd (A), Perfect 5th (C), Major 7th (E)
- **Available Tensions:** 9th (G), #11th (B, the magic note), 13th (D)
- **Sound:** Floating, ethereal, sophisticated. The #11 creates a distinctive bright color.
- **Usage:** Common on IVMaj7 chords. Creates lift and space. Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea use this for color.
- **Why:** The natural 11 (4th) sits a half-step above the 3rd, creating dissonance. Raising it to #11 solves the clash and adds sparkle.

#### For Minor 7 Chords (m7, m9, m11)

**Chord Types:** iim7, iiim7, vim7
**Character:** Transitional, moving toward resolution
**When to Use:** When a minor 7 chord is sounding (Dm7, Em7, Am7 in the key of C)

##### Dorian Mode

- **Formula:** `1 - 2 - b3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - b7`
- **Description:** THE default mode for jazz minor 7 chords. Minor scale with major 6th—sophisticated, not dark.
- **Example:** D Dorian over Dm7: D - E - F - G - A - B - C
- **Chord Tones:** Root (D), Minor 3rd (F), Perfect 5th (A), Minor 7th (C)
- **Available Tensions:** 9th (E), 11th (G), 13th (B)
- **Sound:** Smooth, jazzy minor. The major 6th (B over D) is the characteristic Dorian color—not sad, sophisticated.
- **Usage:** Default for iim7 chords in ii-V-I. Every jazz standard uses this. Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Bill Evans.
- **Why:** Natural minor has b6, which sounds too dark for jazz. Dorian's major 6th fits the sophisticated minor sound jazz needs.
- **Compare:** Natural Minor (Aeolian) has b6 and sounds darker. Dorian has natural 6 and sounds "jazzy."

##### Aeolian Mode (Natural Minor)

- **Formula:** `1 - 2 - b3 - 4 - 5 - b6 - b7`
- **Description:** Darker than Dorian due to b6. Use for vim7 or when you want a sadder minor color.
- **Example:** A Aeolian over Am7: A - B - C - D - E - F - G
- **Chord Tones:** Root (A), Minor 3rd (C), Perfect 5th (E), Minor 7th (G)
- **Available Tensions:** 9th (B), 11th (D), b13th (F)
- **Sound:** Melancholic, darker than Dorian. The b6 (F over A) creates a sad, unresolved quality.
- **Usage:** Use on vim7 when you want more emotional weight. Or on minor tunes in minor keys.
- **When:** Dorian for iim7 (transitional). Aeolian for vim7 or minor key center (final).

#### For Dominant 7 Chords (7, 9, 13, 7alt)

**Chord Types:** V7, secondary dominants (V7/ii, V7/vi)
**Character:** Tension, wanting to resolve
**When to Use:** When a dominant 7 chord is sounding (G7 in the key of C, or secondary dominants like A7, E7)

##### Mixolydian Mode

- **Formula:** `1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - b7`
- **Description:** Major scale with b7. The basic dominant sound.
- **Example:** G Mixolydian over G7: G - A - B - C - D - E - F
- **Chord Tones:** Root (G), Major 3rd (B), Perfect 5th (D), Minor 7th (F)
- **Available Tensions:** 9th (A), 13th (E)
- **Sound:** Bright dominant. The b7 (F) creates the characteristic dominant tension without extra color.
- **Usage:** Default for V7 chords. Clean, straightforward dominant sound. Every jazz player starts here.
- **Tritone:** The 3rd (B) and b7 (F) form a tritone—3 whole steps, extremely dissonant. This interval wants to resolve and defines dominant function.
- **Avoid:** Avoid the 11th (C) on dominant chords—it clashes with the 3rd (B). Either omit it or raise it to #11.

##### Bebop Dominant Scale

- **Formula:** `1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - b7 - 7`
- **Description:** Mixolydian + chromatic passing tone (major 7). Eight notes align chord tones with downbeats when playing eighth notes.
- **Example:** G Bebop Dominant over G7: G - A - B - C - D - E - F - F# (or G - A - B - C - D - E - F - G♭ descending)
- **Chord Tones:** Root (G), Major 3rd (B), Perfect 5th (D), Minor 7th (F)
- **Available Tensions:** 9th (A), 13th (E)
- **Chromatic:** Major 7 (F#) or b7 (Gb descending) acts as passing tone
- **Sound:** Smooth, flowing lines with chord tones landing on strong beats.
- **Usage:** Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie bebop lines. The 8-note structure means chord tones land on beats 1,2,3,4 when playing continuous eighth notes.
- **Why:** Seven-note scales cause chord tones to drift across beat boundaries in eighth-note lines. Eight notes = chord tones align with beats = cleaner phrasing.
- **Practice:** Play ascending: G-A-B-C-D-E-F-F#-G. Play descending: G-F-E-D-C-B-A-G. Chord tones (G,B,D,F) now land on beats.

##### Altered Scale (Super Locrian)

- **Formula:** `1 - b9 - #9 - 3 - b5 - #5 - b7`
- **Description:** Maximum tension scale. Every extension is altered (b9, #9, b5/b13, #5/#11). Use on V7alt chords.
- **Example:** G Altered over G7alt: G - Ab - A# - B - Db - Eb - F
- **Chord Tones:** Root (G), Major 3rd (B), Minor 7th (F)
- **Altered Tensions:** b9 (Ab), #9 (A#/Bb), b5/#11 (Db), #5/b13 (Eb)
- **Sound:** Dissonant, tense, "outside." Creates maximum instability before resolution.
- **Usage:** Modern jazz, bebop, when V7 chord is marked "alt" or when you want maximum tension. John Coltrane, McCoy Tyner.
- **When:** Use when the chord chart says "G7alt" or "G7#5" or "G7b9". Don't use on regular V7—save for maximum drama.
- **Resolution:** The altered tensions resolve beautifully: b9 (Ab) down to 5 (G on CMaj7), #5 (Eb) down to 3 (E on CMaj7).

##### Whole Tone Scale

- **Formula:** `1 - 2 - 3 - #4 - #5 - b7`
- **Description:** Symmetrical scale—all whole steps. Creates floating, ambiguous sound. Use on V7 with #5 or augmented chords.
- **Example:** G Whole Tone over G7#5: G - A - B - C# - D# - F
- **Chord Tones:** Root (G), Major 3rd (B), Minor 7th (F)
- **Altered Tensions:** #4/#11 (C#), #5/b13 (D#/Eb)
- **Sound:** Dreamy, floating, no tonal center. Feels unresolved and spacey.
- **Usage:** Impressionistic jazz, Debussy-influenced. Herbie Hancock, Bill Evans on augmented chords.
- **When:** Use when you see G7#5, G+, Gaug. Or for color on regular V7 when you want "out" sound.
- **Unique:** Only 2 whole tone scales exist (one starting on C, one on Db). All others are transpositions.

#### For Half-Diminished Chords (m7b5, ø7)

**Chord Types:** iim7b5 (in minor keys), viiø7
**Character:** Fragile, unstable, leading to resolution
**When to Use:** In minor ii-V-i progressions, or on viiø7 chords

##### Locrian Mode

- **Formula:** `1 - b2 - b3 - 4 - b5 - b6 - b7`
- **Description:** The most unstable mode. Minor 3rd and flat 5—defines half-diminished quality.
- **Example:** B Locrian over Bm7b5: B - C - D - E - F - G - A
- **Chord Tones:** Root (B), Minor 3rd (D), Diminished 5th (F), Minor 7th (A)
- **Available Tensions:** b9 (C), 11th (E), b13 (G)
- **Sound:** Dark, tense, unstable. Every interval wants to resolve.
- **Usage:** Use on iim7b5 in minor ii-V-i. Bm7b5 → E7alt → Am in key of A minor.
- **When:** Anytime you see m7b5 or ø7 symbol. Less common than Dorian (major key ii) but essential for minor keys.

### How to Practice Chord-Scale Theory

**Conceptual Framework:** Chord-scale theory sounds complex but it's simple: know the chord, know the root, play the corresponding scale from that root. The progression tells you which chord. The chord type tells you which scale. The scale gives you note choices.

#### Steps

1. **Learn the chord progression**
   - Example: In C: Dm7 - G7 - CMaj7 (ii-V-I)

2. **Identify each chord's root and type**
   - Example: Dm7 (minor 7), G7 (dominant 7), CMaj7 (major 7)

3. **Match each chord to its scale**
   - Example: Dm7 = D Dorian, G7 = G Mixolydian, CMaj7 = C Ionian

4. **Practice playing each scale from its root**
   - Example: D Dorian (D-E-F-G-A-B-C), G Mixolydian (G-A-B-C-D-E-F), C Ionian (C-D-E-F-G-A-B)

5. **Switch scales as chords change**
   - Example: Play D Dorian while Dm7 sounds, switch to G Mixolydian when G7 hits, switch to C Ionian when CMaj7 arrives

#### Practice Exercises

1. **Exercise 1:** Play each scale as whole notes (1 scale per chord). Hear how each scale "fits" its chord.
2. **Exercise 2:** Play chord tones (1-3-5-7) as quarter notes. Add scale tones between chord tones.
3. **Exercise 3:** Improvise freely, switching scales with each chord. Start simple—just hit the root on each change.
4. **Exercise 4:** Learn ii-V-I in all 12 keys. Master this progression everywhere on your instrument.

#### Common Mistake

**Problem:** Playing C major scale over the entire ii-V-I because "it's in the key of C."

**Why it's wrong:** Technically correct (all modes come from C major) but sounds generic. You're not "wrong" but you're missing harmonic color.

**Solution:** Use chord-specific scales. D Dorian emphasizes D-F-A-C (Dm7 chord tones). G Mixolydian emphasizes G-B-D-F (G7 chord tones). Creates melodic interest and harmonic awareness.

**Analogy:** It's like having a 64-color crayon box but only using "blue" instead of "navy," "cerulean," "azure." Chord-scales give you the full palette.

#### Key Insight

All these modes come from the same parent major scale (D Dorian, G Mixolydian, C Ionian are all from C major). But thinking "chord-scale" instead of "key" makes you aware of which notes are chord tones and which are tensions. That awareness creates sophisticated, harmonically-connected melodies.

---

### Typical Keys

Jazz keys are driven by horn instruments (Bb and Eb instruments) and the expectation that musicians can play in all 12 keys.

**Common Keys:** C, F, Bb, Eb, G, Dm, Am (horn-friendly and piano-friendly)

**Why:** Bb and Eb are "concert pitch" keys for saxophones and trumpets (Bb instruments read C, sound Bb). F and Bb are also comfortable for piano. But jazz musicians practice all 12 keys—transposing ii-V-I around the circle of fifths is standard training.

**Avoid:** None—jazz players are expected to handle all keys

**Why Avoid (context):** Jazz culture values fluency in all 12 keys. If you can't play a standard in F#, you're not ready for the bandstand. However, Bb, F, Eb, and C appear most often in the Real Book because they're horn-friendly.

---

### Guide Tones: The Secret to Smooth Jazz Lines

Guide tones are the 3rd and 7th of each chord. These two notes define the chord quality (major vs minor, major 7 vs dominant 7) and create the strongest voice leading.

**Why:** Root and 5th are stable but don't define quality. 3rd says major or minor. 7th says major 7 or dominant 7. Together, they tell you everything.

**Voice Leading:** Guide tones move by step between chords in ii-V-I progressions. This creates smooth, connected lines.

#### Example: Dm7 → G7 → CMaj7

- **Dm7 Guide Tones:** F (3rd), C (7th)
- **G7 Guide Tones:** B (3rd), F (7th)
- **CMaj7 Guide Tones:** E (3rd), B (7th)

**Movement:** F-C (Dm7) → B-F (G7) → E-B (CMaj7). Notice: C stays as common tone to F, then F moves to E (half-step), B stays as common tone.

#### Practice

**Exercise:** Play only guide tones over ii-V-I backing tracks. Alternate 3rd and 7th, or play both together. Hear how they define the progression.

**Next Step:** Add chord roots. Now you have 1-3-7 (shell voicing). Add scale tones between to create melodies.

**Mastery:** Great jazz lines ALWAYS hit guide tones on strong beats. The rest is decoration.

#### Bebop Secret

Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie built bebop lines by outlining guide tones with chromatic approaches. Fast lines = guide tones + chromatic passing tones. Slow it down and you'll see 3rds and 7ths on downbeats.

---

## Rhythm & Feel

### Swing Feel

**Description:** Jazz swing—the pulse is written as straight eighth notes but FELT as triplets. The "and" lags behind, creating forward momentum.

**Time Signature:** 4/4

**Important:** Swing is feel-based, learned by listening to recordings.

---

## Licks

### The ii-V-I Bebop Line

**The most important lick in jazz**

**Keys:** In C: Dm7 (F-E-D-C#) → G7 (B-Bb-A-G#) → CMaj7 (E-D-C#-B). Guide tones with chromatic approaches.

**Guitar:** Play guide tones with chromatic approach notes.

---

## Practice Resources

### Backing Tracks

**Search:** "Jazz ii-V-I backing track" or jazz standards by name

**Listen For:** Walking bass, swinging hi-hat, clear chord changes

**Recommended Tempos:**
- 120 BPM (medium)
