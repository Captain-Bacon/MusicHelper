'Gospel': {
  theory: {
    overview: 'Gospel is built on rich harmonic movement and emotional expression. Extended chords (9ths, 11ths, 13ths) are the default—not fancy additions. The sound comes from chromatic voice leading, cluster voicings, and the constant push-pull of tension and release. Where blues stays on the I7 chord, Gospel keeps moving.',

    melodicApproach: {
      title: 'Gospel Melody: Chord Tones + Chromatic Motion',
      coreIdea: 'Gospel melody doesn\'t stay in scales—it moves through CHORD TONES connected by CHROMATIC RUNS. You\'re not "in G Mixolydian," you\'re "targeting G7 chord tones and approaching them chromatically with runs and slides."',

      howItWorks: {
        explanation: 'Over a Gospel progression (Dm7 → G7 → CMaj7), you target the chord tones of each chord and connect them with chromatic passing tones and runs. The motion IS the Gospel sound.',
        dm7Example: 'Target D, F, A, C (Dm7 chord tones). Connect them with chromatic motion—E-Eb-D, F-E-F, G-Ab-A.',
        g7Example: 'Target G, B, D, F (G7 chord tones). Use the 3-to-1 slide: B-Bb-A-Ab-G. Or chromatic walkup: F-F#-G.',
        cmaj7Example: 'Target C, E, G, B (CMaj7 chord tones). Land on root with the 3-to-1: E-Eb-D-Db-C. This is THE Gospel ending.'

          description: 'From scale degree 3, descend chromatically to root. THE signature Gospel lick.',
          inC: 'E - Eb - D - Db - C (or E - Eb - D - C for quicker version)',
          when: 'End of phrases, landing on I chord, turnarounds. Gospel pianists do this every 4 bars.',
          why: 'Creates inevitable, smooth resolution. The chromatic descent (half-steps) pulls strongly to the root.',
          practice: 'Learn in all 12 keys. This appears in EVERY Gospel song. Literally every one.'
        },

        chromaticWalkup: {
          name: 'Chromatic Walkup to Next Chord',
          description: 'Walk up chromatically to the root (or 5th) of the next chord. Fast 16th notes.',
          example: 'C to G7: play C-C#-D-D#-E-F-F#-G (landing on G7 in next bar)',
          when: 'Last beat of the measure, connecting one chord to the next.',
          why: 'Fills space, creates forward momentum, builds energy.',
          speed: 'FAST. Practice slowly, speed up until it sounds like a blur. Gospel runs are quick.',
          practice: 'Pick two chords. Find chromatic path between their roots. Walk it in 16th notes until automatic.'
        },

        chromaticApproachTones: {
          name: 'Half-Step Approaches to Chord Tones',
          description: 'Don\'t land directly on chord tones—approach from half-step above or below.',
          example: 'Landing on C (root of CMaj7): approach from B (below) or Db (above). Creates smooth, inevitable resolution.',
          overG7: 'Over G7, approach B (3rd) from Bb. Approach F (7th) from E or Gb. These are guide tones—most important to target.',
          why: 'Half-step motion is STRONG. It creates expectation and smooth voice leading.',
          practice: 'Over any chord, play chord tones approached chromatically. Don\'t jump—glide into every important note.'
        }
      },

      vsJazz: 'Jazz uses chord-scale theory (stay in D Dorian over Dm7, switch to G Mixolydian over G7). Gospel uses chord-tone targeting + chromatic motion. More freedom, more runs, more "churchy" energy.',

      vsBlues: 'Blues uses one scale over the whole progression (minor pentatonic/blues scale). Gospel changes focus with each chord, following the harmony closely with chromatic connection.',

      vsNeoSoul: 'Neo-Soul uses chromatic approaches for smoothness and laid-back feel (one half-step, then resolve). Gospel uses chromatic RUNS for energy and excitement (8-note chromatic walkup at full speed).',

      keyInsight: 'Gospel melody is FUNCTIONAL, not scalar. You\'re creating voice-leading between chords, not playing scales. The 3-to-1 slide, chromatic walkups, and approach tones are your tools. Scales are just reference—the motion is what matters.'
    },

    referenceScales: {
      title: 'Reference Scales (Context, Not Rules)',
      explanation: 'These scales show the HARMONIC CONTEXT for Gospel—which notes fit the underlying chords. But don\'t think "I\'m playing in this scale now." Gospel is CHROMATIC—you use all 12 notes as passing tones, runs, and connectors. The scales just show the framework.',

      gospelScale: {

        example: 'In C: C - D - Eb - E - F - G - A - Bb',
        usage: 'This shows available melodic colors. The b3→3 movement (Eb to E) is quintessentially Gospel—that "sweet and sour" sound.',
        context: 'You see this scale and think: "I can slide from Eb to E for Gospel flavor." Not "I must stay within these 8 notes."',
        chromatic: 'But remember: Gospel uses ALL 12 notes. This scale is a reference, not a boundary.'
      },

      mixolydian: {
        name: 'Mixolydian Mode',
        formula: '1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - b7',
        description: 'Major with b7. Shows available notes when sitting on dominant 7th chords.',
        example: 'In G: G - A - B - C - D - E - F',
        usage: 'When Gospel vamps on a V7 chord (G7) for multiple bars, these notes fit the harmony.',
        context: 'Useful when you\'re sustaining one dominant chord. But between chords? Chromatic runs.',
        extensions: 'G7 chord = G-B-D-F. Mixolydian adds 9th (A), 13th (E) as safe extensions. But b9 (Ab) is also Gospel—not in Mixolydian but used constantly.'
      },

      caveat: 'Gospel is CHROMATIC VOICE-LEADING music. You\'re not "in a scale"—you\'re moving between chord tones using chromatic glue. If you try to "stay in Gospel scale" or "stay in Mixolydian," you\'ll miss the chromatic runs that define the sound. Use the scales as reference for harmonic context, but think "chord tones + chromatic motion" when you play.'
    },

    colorTones: {
      description: 'Gospel uses chromatic tones for color and voice leading—they\'re passing tones and tension notes, not defining characteristics like Blues.',
      notes: [
        { note: 'b3 (flat third)', usage: 'Quick slide from b3 to 3 in runs. Creates the "churchy" sound. More passing tone than destination. The Eb→E slide in C is iconic Gospel.' },
        { note: 'b7 (flat seventh)', usage: 'The sound of dominant 7th chords (every V7). Gospel sits on this tension longer than Blues, building anticipation before resolving.' },
        { note: 'b9 (flat ninth)', usage: 'The "illegal" note. Play b9 over dominant chords for maximum tension. Kirk Franklin uses this CONSTANTLY. Sounds "wrong" but resolves beautifully. On G7, play Ab (b9) in cluster with B (3rd)—extreme dissonance, perfect resolution to C.' }
      ],
      chromaticContext: 'These are not "scale degrees"—they\'re CHROMATIC TENSIONS. You use them for color, then resolve. Gospel doesn\'t avoid "wrong" notes—it leans into dissonance and resolves it with voice leading.'
    },

    harmonyVsBlues: {
      title: 'Gospel vs Blues: Harmony in Motion',
      explanation: 'Blues stays on one chord (I7) for 4 bars. Gospel moves CONSTANTLY—ii7 → V7 → I in 2 bars, often with chromatic passing chords in between.',
      example: 'In C: Dm7 (ii) → G7 (V) → CMaj7 (I) is the foundation. But Gospel adds: Dm7 → Db7 → CMaj7 (chromatic approach). Or: Dm7 → G7 → CMaj7 → Am7 → D7 → GMaj7 (immediate re-pivot to new key).',
      why: 'Gospel inherited Blues\' emotional core but added Jazz\'s harmonic sophistication. More chords = more opportunities for tension and release = more emotional peaks.',
      melodicImplication: 'Because chords change every 1-2 bars, Gospel melody must TRACK the harmony. You can\'t play one scale over everything—you must follow the chord progression with chord-tone targeting and chromatic connection.'

      answer: 'Major 7th chords (1-3-5-7) sound too resolved and pretty for Gospel tension points. The b7 in dominant chords creates the "unresolved yearning" that Gospel exploits. Every V chord (and secondary dominants) uses dominant 7th to create tension that resolves to major 7th.',
      comparison: 'In C: CMaj7 (C-E-G-B) sounds complete and peaceful—this is the RESOLUTION. G7 (G-B-D-F) sounds restless and edgy—this is the TENSION. Gospel lives in that tension-release cycle.'
